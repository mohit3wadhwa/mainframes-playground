# Mainframe Playground

A collection of hands-on samples for IBM Mainframe technologies: COBOL, JCL, REXX, VSAM, Db2, IMS, MQ and common utilities.

## Folder structure

- `cobol/` – COBOL programs (basic, files, VSAM, Db2, IMS, MQ, utilities).
- `jcl/` – JCL jobs for compilation, DB2 utilities, VSAM, SORT/JOIN, IMS, MQ.
- `rexx/` – REXX scripts for TSO and ISPF automation.
- `docs/` – Concept overviews and diagrams.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Pick a topic (e.g. `cobol/basic/hello_world.cbl` and `jcl/cobol_compile_link_run/jcl_run_cobol.jcl`).
3. Adapt dataset names, load libraries, and subsystem names for your site.
4. Compile and run on z/OS or in your emulator/sandbox.

Contributions are welcome: add new examples, improve comments, or suggest new topics via issues/PRs.
